# causalR (development version)

* `get_hte()` and `plt_hte_sub()` account for shared clusters when testing
  differences between subgroup effects, retaining grf's marginal variances.
* `get_hte()` and `plt_hte_dep()` now use the forest's observation weights
  and clusters for covariate heterogeneity tests and doubly robust curves.
